# PM Portfolio – Jorgo Qirjaj

This is my personal **PM Portfolio**, (work in progress), built using **Next.js**, **Orchids AI**, and **Claude AI** as a creative coding assistant.  

It’s a small project where I experiment with front-end development and “vibe coding”. 

**Live site:** [jorgoqirjaj.com](https://jorgoqirjaj.com)

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

To run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
````

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see it live.

You can start editing the homepage by modifying:

```bash
app/page.tsx
```

The page will auto-update as you edit the file.
