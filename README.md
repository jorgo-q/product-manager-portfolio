# 🌐 PM Portfolio – Jorgo Qirjaj

This is my personal **PM Portfolio**, (work in progress), built using **Next.js**, **Orchids AI**, and **Claude AI** as a creative coding assistant.  
It’s a small project where I experiment with front-end development, product storytelling, and “vibe coding”, focusing on blending design and tech.
